## First 
I created te raw html of the site adding *IDs* and *classes* to the elements as I saw fit in order to style them later with the idea of creating a reusable *CSS* library.

## Second 
I styled the main sections  of the site (*header*, *article* and *footer*) each on their own CSS file.

## Third 
I started the styling for the mobile version using the *inspect* tool on the browser setting up the max with at 480px. On this first version the navigation bar of the header stays hidden and it can be latter call upon with a menu button. There is a section with images at the bottom of the page, before the footer, that stack up one op top of each other on the mobile version and they will show side by side from 480px. Finally the liks section in the footer will behave in a similar fashion, the links are shown on top of each other and from 480px they will be shown side by side.
