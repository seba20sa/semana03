## First 
I created te raw html of the site adding *IDs* and *classes* to the elements as I saw fit in order to style them later with the idea of creating a reusable *CSS* library.

## Second 
I styled the main sections  of the site (*header*, *article* and *footer*) each on their own CSS file.

## Third 
I started the styling for the mobile version using the *inspect* tool on the browser setting up the max with at 480px. On this first version the navigation bar on the header stays hidden and it can be latter call upon with a menu button. There is a section with images at the bottom of the page, before the footer, that stack up one op top of each other on the mobile version and they will show side by side from 768px on, 3 on each row for 900 and 4 together from 1024. Finally the liks section in the footer will behave in a similar fashion, the links are shown on top of each other and from 768px  on they will be shown side by side.  

## Fourth
Continued with media queries for content from 900px, 1024px and 1200 px using larger text lines and bigger fonts for the latter one taking into account that it's oriented for browning on a smart TV. 

## Fifth
Created an article link bar that shows only 3 article links up to 900px, 6 links up to 1200px and 9 links from there. Made some final adjustments on fonts sizes for all the different sizes. 

## Sixth
The ads section behaves in a similar fashion than the article link bar, once it gets to 1024px a new ad
appears in order to take advantage of the new aviable space.
